                <p class="team-bio">Nice to meet you! I’m Mikaela, and I’m a 4th year Informatics major specializing in HCI. In my free time, 
                    I like reading, watching movies, hiking, and snowboarding. As a stressed college student, music has always  been an escape for me. 
                    My favorite artists are Mk.gee, Fleetword Mac, Cleo Sol, and the Beatles. Creating The Bright Side has taught me the positive impact of sound bowl 
                    meditation on our wellness. After creating this app, I've started incorporating it in my routine, and this app
                    is something that would be useful for someone like me because it offers the flexibility many students like me wish for.</p>

                <p class="team-bio">Hey there! Im Denise and I am a 4th year Informatics major specializing in Health. Designing The Bright Side has taught me a great deal about user preferences through research, 
                    enabling me to create more effective designs. I didn't really know much about sound bowl meditation before, 
                    but now I think it's such a unique and creative way for people to relax and find inner peace through sound. 
                    I believe our app offers something special for sound bowl meditation lovers, providing a space for them to explore and connect with these calming vibrations. I truly believe music is an important aspect in life for a person’s well being, some of my favorite artists include Pierce the Veil, Inner Wave, and The Maria’s!.</p>
